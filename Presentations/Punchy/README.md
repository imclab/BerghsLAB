#Punchy

Hi Superhero,

Have you ever felt that fighting in real life is boring? As long as you step out of the video game, fighting suddenly becomes… not exciting? 
Let us introduce to you Punchy! Punchy is your new device that brings fun back into your fights!

We know, we all think we are action heroes. Especially when we fight. Punchy brings your fantasies into reality while fighting. When you punch someone, a sound effect and a picture visualizing the hit comes up on your screen. From now on fighting in real life is just as exciting as in the video games. POW!
