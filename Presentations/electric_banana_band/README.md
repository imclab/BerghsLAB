###Process

- Code that played different kind of sounds, that we got from Paulo.
- Started tweaking it, by putting in new music files.
- Create a illustration of a banana, and separate the different clothing styles in different layers.
- Started of using script to import audio and create a audio player for a specific key pressed. (UP,DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT Arrows)
- Implement code to load a shape build up in different layers, and load the different layers for a specific key pressed.
- We wanted the banana to move(dance) and therefor made a "posX" and adding it to every shape.
- We felt that something was missing, so we added a disco background.
