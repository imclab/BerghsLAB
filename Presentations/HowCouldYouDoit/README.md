#\'94Would you do it?\'94\
\
What if you were given the opportunity to torture a defenseless little creature, without any consequences for you? Would you do it? This is the question that we\'92re asking with our project. By creating a modern \'94voodoo doll\'94 we put your morals to the test, exploring profound human evilness and lack of compassion.\
\
We hooked up a bunch of wires to a knife, giving you the opportunity to stab a toy bunny. Each stab to the bunny results in critical damage to its virtual avatar which screams and stares panicked at the wounds you inflict.\
\
If you stab the bunny enough times it will die.\
\uc0\u8232 Would you do it?\
