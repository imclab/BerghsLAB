#The Anton dream
We were asked to use a character to make something eyecatching and interactive using the makey makey set and processing. We realized we had a character in our group "Anton" and decided to use him (and his body) to make an interactive strip show. By pressing the button you remove a piece of clothing and finally you have a naked Anton, all to the sweet tunes of Marvin Gaye.
