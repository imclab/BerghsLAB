// A program can have variables...

// Variables are a handy way to store data
// that needs to be used in multiple places
// of your program.

int number = 10; // stores the integer 10 in a variable named "number"

int sum = number + number; // store the result of the sum of 10 + 10

// There are several types of variables (and you can create your own!)
// but now we will focus on the "primitives".

float fraction = 0.25; // "float" can store number fractions

String text = "Hello Berghs!"; // "String" can store any arbitrary text!

// "boolean" can only be true or false
boolean skyIsRed = false;
boolean skyIsBlue = true;

// Once defined, a variable can't change it's "type".
// Uncomment the line bellow and look to your console
// text = number;
