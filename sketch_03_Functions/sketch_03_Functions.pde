int number = 10;

// A program can also have functions...

// A function like a variable, but instead of storing a simple
// value, it stores a piece of code, that you can run at any time.

void doubleNumber(){
  number = number * 2;
}

// Every time we run the "doubleNumber()" function, we will
// double the value that is stored in "number"
